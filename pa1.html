        <h2>About Goku </h2>
        <p>
            <em>Son Gokū </em>is a fictional character and main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong, a main character in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West and Superman, with whom he
            shares a very similar origin story.

        <h2>Kid Goku</h2>
        <p>
            Initially believed to have been born on Earth, Goku later learns that he is a member of an extraterrestrial warrior race called the Saiyans, which is also the reason for his superhuman strength, and his birth name is Kakarot (カカロット Kakarotto).
            As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and protects his adopted home planet from those who seek to destroy it. Goku is depicted as carefree and cheerful when at ease, but quickly serious and strategic-minded when in battle
            and also enthusiastic to fight. He is able to concentrate his Ki and use it for devastatingly powerful energy-based attacks; the most prominent being his signature Kamehameha (かめはめ波), in which Goku launches a blue energy blast from his palms.

        <h2>Squad</h2>
        <p>
            Yamcha (ヤムチャ Yamucha), known as Zedaki in the Harmony Gold dub, is introduced as a desert bandit alongside his constant companion Puar, trying to steal Goku and Bulma's Dragon Balls and wish not to feel nervous when near women. Kuririn (クリリン), Krillin
            in the English anime dub, is a bald martial artist and one of Goku's best friends. He is the classmate of Goku under Master Roshi's tutelage; Tenshinhan (天津飯テンシンハン), named Tien Shinhan in the Funimation anime dub and also known as Shinto in
            the Harmony Gold dub, is first introduced, having been trained by Master Roshi's rival Master Shen, trying to kill Goku and his fellow-students Piccolo (ピッコロ Pikkoro) is the spawn of King Piccolo, created to get revenge on Goku in the wake
            of his death, subsequently assuming the role as the "evil half" of Kami.[ch. 161, 165] However, after just narrowly being defeated by Goku, he has to team up with him and his friends when opposing the invading Saiyans, including training Goku's
            son Gohan. Son Gohan (孫悟飯) is Goku's eldest son with Chi-Chi, who first appears at the age of four years. Vegeta (ベジータ Bejīta) is the last prince of the Saiyan people, and the fourth generation of the Saiyan royal bloodline to bear his namesake.
